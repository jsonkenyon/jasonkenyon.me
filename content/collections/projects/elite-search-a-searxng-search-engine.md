  Google and DuckDuckGo, are all good search engines.  However, a good buddy of mine and I wanted something a bit more private and privacy-focused.  We found SearXNG and how it was open source and it was a meta-search engine.  So I quickly got up a hosting plan with Linode and got it up and running.   It's the no logs, no bullshit, privacy-focused search engine. 

  Lately, I've been working on re-theming it, It's a long process, but once I have it fully skinned I will look deeper into the coding of it to see if I can optimize the customizations that I have done a bit better and continue to provide it free/opensource for others to use a themes.
