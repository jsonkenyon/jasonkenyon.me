title: 'Alfred Bot'
project_content: |-
  Alfred Bot, just like BreakDaddy, was an application that was made for the same company as Break Daddy that would assist supervisors in their daily activities.  When all of your communications is going through Slack, I always had the thought that it would be best to never have to leave this application if you didn't have to. 

  So what if you could just do some slash commands and fill out a modal, and it would insert the data into a Google Drive Doc, or Google Drive Sheet, etc. Which this is exactly what the application was made to do, built using Laravel, Slack API, and Google Docs. A custom slack driver was developed to allow the modal creation, and attachments were changed out to be messages built with the blocks.
