title: 'Break Daddy'
project_content: 'An application that was built using Laravel, Vuejs, Moment.js, and using the Slack API. It allowed a company to automate their breaks to ensure that the supervisors were free to do what they needed to do. E.g.: paperwork, speaking with agents, etc.  As I no longer work with the company the code has been archived and remains closed source, and owned by that company.'
