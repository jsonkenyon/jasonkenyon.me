  Hey there, I'm Jason. A husband, father, Laravel enthusiast, living in Virginia. I'm also a mechanical keyboard enthusiast; I love to build different kinds of keyboards, with all different types of switches. Sometimes, you can catch me on Twitch streaming the keyboard builds. I love working on projects that solve an itch, an issue, or something that is just painful to continue to do manually. Most of my development has been for personal, or work related adventures, though I'm hoping to change that and get into the OSS, and release some things to the public.

  I'm a big technology guru, that enjoys networking, macOS, and Linux.  I'm always looking to learn anything and everything that I can, including setting up my home network, running [PFSense](https://www.pfsense.org/){:target="_blank"}, Cisco Switches, and monitoring all devices and network using SNMP.
