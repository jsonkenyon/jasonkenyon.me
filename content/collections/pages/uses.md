      ### [2022 Mac Studio](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-studio/10-core-cpu-24-core-gpu-16-core-neural-engine-32gb-memory-512gb){:target="_blank"}

      For the longest time, I was using the all-in-one 2015 27" iMac. Though I wanted to slim down the profile of what I was using on my desk, I thought about getting a Macbook for a while, and just using a dock to connect the screens to it; this would also allow me to just run around with it, but there is always just something about having a stay on the desk system that I'm attached to.   This Mac studio does everything I need, and the M1 chip in it is the real deal. I do have plans on getting a Macbook Pro, that Macbook still won't replace the studio. 

      ### [Apple Studio Display](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Studio-Display-Standard-Tilt-Adjustable/dp/B09V3HGN6Q?crid=2BHH2AJJW2YNU&keywords=apple+studio+display&qid=1681364242&sprefix=apple+studio+display,aps,69&sr=8-2&th=1){:target="_blank"}

      It would always be nice to have a fancy XDR display from Apple.  Though let's be honest, that thing is just a massive chunk of change and what I do it just doesn't justify paying that price for it. The Mac Studio displays pair well with the Mac Studio, and it just gets the job done.  I was using a Dell 27" monitor, and while it was a great 4K monitor, its biggest downfall was when the Mac Studio was sleeping and the screen would just take so long to come alive, this doesn't happen with the Studio Display, and it's like instant.  

      ### [Qwiizlab USB C Hub Docking Station](https://qwiizlab.net/products/uh25-max){:target="_blank"}

      There are times that I need a bit more I/O ports, and this little Qwiizlabs docking station does just that. Not only does it provide me with a bit more USB ports, but it also has a place where I can install an NVMe drive and SSD drive.  

      While using the NVMe and SSD drives installed in it, they don't get their full read and write, though they're fast enough that, I don't notice that it's actually external.  I actually use the NVMe drive to mount the directory that MySQL is running in from homebrew, and also the coding directory. I also use the SSD function in it to host the games that I play on steam so that they aren't on my main storage in the Mac Studio. 

      ### [AM Compact Touch - Nightdrve Edition](https://www.angrymiao.com/am-compact-touch/){:target="_blank"}

      As a keyboard enthusiast, I'm forever looking for an endgame keyboard. I have always been fascinated by the [HHKB](https://hhkeyboard.us/hhkb/Pro-Classic){:target="_blank"} keyboard and the layout of the HHKB. However, my passion resides with mechanical keyboards, while the HHKB has Topre electrostatic capacitive switches.

      This keyboard fills a void where I was looking to have an almost HHKB layout, with some subtle differences, such as the spacebar is 7u instead of 6u like the HHKB, the arrow keys are a touch panel on the Compact Touch (hence the name).

      Current specs: 
      - [TX Stabilizers](https://kirballskeys.com/tx-stabilizers/){:target="_blank"} 1.2mm PCB Mount
      - [Gateron Oil King](https://lumekeebs.com/products/gateron-oil-king-linear-switches){:target="_blank"} switches - lubed and filmed
      - [GMK Dracula V2.0 Keycaps](https://omnitype.com/products/gmk-dracula-v2-0-keycaps?variant=41621405565097){:target="_blank"} - Git Core Base.

      ### [Logitech MX Master 3s](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-MX-Master-3S-Pale/dp/B09HM94VDS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=J9GYFLB402L0&keywords=logitech+mx+master+3s&qid=1669501286&sprefix=logitech+mx+master+3s,aps,73&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do:amzn1.fos.08f69ac3-fd3d-4b88-bca2-8997e41410bb&th=1){:target="_blank"}

      Previously, I was using the Logitech MX Master 3 Mac version. It's a great mouse, though I didn't really like the clicks of the mouse buttons, and then along came the 3S version, which makes the clicks silent. So, I upgraded to the 3S version, though I didn't opt for the Mac verison only this time and got the one with the dongle.   The Logitech MX Master 3S also supports a higher DPI sensor, which is always a bonus. 

      ### [YubiKeys](https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5c-nfc/){:target="_blank"}

      Instead of using 2FA, etc., I always use my Yubikeys for securing my account and MacOS. I also store my GPG keys in my [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5c-nfc/){:target="_blank"}. I don't store my private keys on my computer, instead, it is stored in an encrypted USB drive that is only ever plugged into an air-gapped computer that is used only for generating GPG keys and things like that. 

      ### [Belkin BoostCharge Pro](https://www.belkin.com/3-in-1-wireless-charging-pad-with-magsafe/P-WIZ016.html){:target="_blank"}

      I have the iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple Watch, and AirPods Pro 2.  Keeping them charged and on the ready when I need them, I depend on the Belkin boost wireless charger that allows me to charge all three of these devices together, and keep them charged and ready to go when I need them. 

      ### [Progressive Adjustable Standing Desk](https://www.progressivedesk.com/products/solo-ryzer){:target="_blank"}
      While I have a super comfy office/gaming chair to sit in, sometimes you just want to get up and stand a bit and get some work done.  This desk allows me to do that, though I do have plans to replace this desk with the [SecretLab Magnus Pro](https://secretlab.co/pages/magnus-pro){:target="_blank"} Desk.  The desk that I'm using now would be repurposed for when I do streams and build keyboards etc. 

      ### [Secretlab Titan Evo XL](https://secretlab.co/products/titan-evo-2022-series){:target="_blank"}

      Previously, I was using the Ikea Markus chair. It was a great chair. Truly the only one that really fits me, as I'm 6'3. However, the padding in the chair had really started to give and became super uncomfortable. So I was in the market for a new one, and I looked at the Herman Miller Aeron chair, and the Secretlab Titan, I decided to go ahead and get the Secretlab chair, and to be honest it's super comfy and I have even fallen asleep in the chair multiple times.

      ### [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/){:target="_blank"}

      Battle-tested and well-developed iTerm2 is the goto terminal for MacOS.  I have attempted to use Warp terminal, and honestly, I just didn't like it or the fact that you had to have an account just to use a terminal application.  That's a big no-thanks for me. 

      ### [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"}

      I always reach for VSCode to work on code and edit projects. Thanks to Caleb Porzio's course on [MakeVSCodeAwesome](https://makevscodeawesome.com/){:target="_blank"}, it's truly visually appealing. There for a bit, I switched to VSCodium as VSCode made some changes that broke the plugins that made MakeVSCodeAwesome unable to skin the editor anymore. However, there has been a new extension, [Apc Customize UI++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drcika.apc-extension){:target="_blank"}, that has come out that allows us to regain that control skin it, and take full advantage of the MakeVSCodeAwesome again with just a few minor tweaks! 

      ### [Homebrew](https://apple.com){:target="_blank"}

      Homebrew is a lifesaver.  I come from a web hosting background using CentOS, and cPanel servers; so yum commands are truly something that I missed in MacOS, though Homebrew changes this, so if it can be installed via brew or with brew --cask that's what I'm using!

      ### [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/){:target="_blank"}

      Let's be honest; I'm lazy, so a quick and easy way to set up to get Laravel projects up and running and being able to test is just absolutely fabulous. Before Laravel Herd, I was using Laravel Valet, which had no downfall to it. It's still amazing. I would use it again if needed, but having the static binaries for PHP, NGINX, and dnsmasq is just incredible, and super fast! 

      ### [TablePlus](https://apple.com){:target="_blank"}

      Tableplus is my go-to management tool for dealing with anything database-related.  I used to use the [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/){:target="_blank"}, though it had stopped being actively developed and just had a bunch of bugs/crashing, although [Sequal Ace](https://sequel-ace.com/){:target="_blank"} has come out, it was a bit too late.  I had started to use Tableplus and its GUI is just well, better polished. 

      ### [Arc Browser](https://apple.com){:target="_blank"}

      Arc is hands down the Chrome replacement browser, while it runs on the same Chromium engine that powers Chrome, it brings some new features and a visual facelift that was much needed to the way web browsers look and feel. After using it for a bit, I honestly can't imagine not using Arc as my default browser. 

      ### [Element](https://element.io/){:target="_blank"}

      I used to use Discord for chatting and talking with friends, this was quickly replaced by Element for the most part.  A buddy of mine hosts this on his server, so we know it's for the most part safe and our data isn't getting sent anywhere.  While I still use Discord for some things, I'm normally only using it in the browser and don't have Discord installed on my Mac. 

      ### [Keybase](https://keybase.io/){:target="_blank"}

      Keybase was simply brilliant before Zoom bought them, though even though Zoom has bought them, I still continue to use it to provide my public GPG key, and to verify that I do indeed own the websites, accounts, etc. 

      ### [Vaultwarden/BitWarden](https://www.passwordstore.org/){:target="_blank"}

      Let's all be honest, Sometimes we re-use passwords, or if we don't we can't remember every single password that we use.  I self-host a [Vaultwaden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden){:target="_blank"} installation on one of my home servers, among other docker containers.  This is hands down the best solution that I could come up with, and I love it.  My passwords are safe and secure in a home lab and never touch a database/file system that is connected to the internet.  If I need to sync my passwords on my phone when I'm out and about, I simply VPN into my network and sync my passwords, it's that simple and quick.
